# Knowledge at your fingertips doesn’t guarantee understanding.

Imagine walking into a classroom where every student has a superintelligent assistant. This assistant can answer questions instantly, generate explanations, create personalized exercises, and offer feedback. At first this seems amazing. After all, personalized learning for students may help all students learn equally well. 

But what would it mean for learning when the answers are always at your fingertips? What happens to curiosity, resilience, and human connection in such an environment?

Education has always been about more than just knowing the answers. At its heart, it prepares people to think deeply, make informed choices, and thrive in communities. That mission doesn’t vanish in the age of artificial intelligence. 

What changes are the tools we have at our disposal and the consequences if we misuse them.

## What does it mean to learn?
Learning is effortful, sometimes frustrating, and occasionally humbling. Yet a simple truth remains that we learn best when we struggle a little.

Psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky distinguished between two modes of thought:
* **System 1**: the fast, intuitive part of our brain
* **System 2**: the slower, deliberate reasoning we engage when analyzing and reflecting

Deep learning requires sustained engagement of System 2, allowing skills practiced deliberately to eventually become automatic in System 1. 

Cognitive load theory (and, frankly, most of our experiences in college) shows that we're unable to passively absorb complex concepts. Instead we need repetition, reflection, and challenge to commit knowledge into long-term memory. It’s why schools emphasize daily practice, weekly repetition, and a bit of a challenge to drive growth. 

Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development makes the same point, that growth happens when students are stretched just beyond their comfort zones, challenged yet not overwhelmed.

Consider a student learning algebra. They work through equations, make mistakes, and gradually build an intuitive model of how to approach different problems. This struggle and experimentation strengthens reasoning skills and lays the foundation for problem solving across contexts. It’s why prestigious universities often say their students “learn how to learn”. The rigor itself is what shapes lasting cognitive habits.

If AI is used primarily as a shortcut, that struggle disappears. The student may see the answer but wouldn’t internalize the reasoning behind it, hence knowledge remains superficial. As we know, true learning isn’t simply knowing what is correct. It’s understanding why it’s correct and being able to apply and adapt that reasoning in unfamiliar situations.

Maybe AI can support this process if it is treated as a guide, not a replacement.

## Lessons from History (and from the Classroom)
This isn't the first time technology has been hailed as “revolutionary” for education.

Thomas Edison once predicted motion pictures would replace textbooks. Radio and television were promised to democratize knowledge. Decades later, MOOCs (massive open online courses) were said to make elite education universally accessible. Each of these innovations served as great tools for access to information, but none “revolutionized” the education system itself. 

As historian Larry Cuban observed in *Oversold and Underused*, the impact of technology in classrooms has consistently fallen short of the hype. Why? 

Because education is inherently a social ecosystem, not just the delivery of content. 

Students become learners through relationships. It’s the encouragement of a teacher, the support or challenge of a peer, the example of a mentor in which growth takes root. Knowledge isn’t delivered, rather it’s cultivated in conversation and shared experience.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted this reality. Remote learning kept schooling ongoing, but without in-person connection, many students fell behind. McKinsey estimated that U.S. students lost, on average, five months of progress in math and four months in reading after extended closures. Screens delivered information, but without real peers and teachers in the room, students were less likely to participate, less likely to connect, and less engaged overall.

I’ve seen this dynamic firsthand. Since 2018, I’ve taught math both remotely and in person, and I have to say, I love teaching in person far more. I can more easily connect personally with the students, and they’re also more engaged because I can give each of them attention. Walking around the classroom while they work on a problem lets me spot when someone is stuck and offer a quick nudge. Putting them into small groups for math games or challenge problems gives them a chance to wrestle with ideas together, learn from one another, and build confidence.

At Carnegie Mellon, as a TA for 15-281 for five semesters, I saw the same thing with college students I taught. Engaged students challenged assumptions, tested their reasoning against ours, and grew stronger problem solving skills as they muddled through assignments. Several of my students went on to become TAs themselves, continuing this cycle of guided struggle and learning that no tool could replicate.

Teaching and learning go hand in hand. A teacher surveys the room, guides, and nudges, and a dedicated student works, struggles, and grows. Those small human interactions among the questions and shared epiphanies, are the heart of real learning. They’re also the reason past technologies, no matter how impressive, have never fully delivered.

## Where AI Fits

I believe AI does have the potential to aid education if it’s used in the right ways, complementing rather than replacing human learning. Its impact differs depending on the learner and the context.

**For teachers**: AI can handle routine tasks like grading and creating practice problems, giving educators more time for what only humans can do: mentoring, guiding, and inspiring students. Anthropic’s initiatives show how AI can help teachers manage administrative work, track progress, and spot learning patterns. UNESCO similarly emphasizes that well-designed AI lets teachers focus on connecting with students and fostering curiosity and creativity. In short, AI can and should reduce the manual load and amplify what good teachers already do, not replace them.

**For students**: AI can be a powerful supplemental tool, similar to digital flashcards or a Quizlet tutor at home, helping students reinforce skills and practice concepts outside the classroom. 

However, it shouldn’t be the primary source of learning. The core of education is engaging System 2 (deliberate reasoning, struggle, and problem-solving) in order to build up System 1 skills (automatic, intuitive knowledge) for students to carry forward. When thoughtfully applied, AI can help maintain and strengthen System 1 skills, but it should not replace the effortful, reflective work that forms them.

**For professionals and lifelong learners**: AI opens new possibilities for ongoing, adaptive learning. For adults who already have a strong foundation of System 2 skills, AI can provide personalized micro-learning, delivering bite-sized lessons tailored to interests and goals. Imagine replacing idle scrolling before bed with an AI app that teaches a small concept or skill every night.

Note that even for lifelong learning, the foundation matters. Children must learn to think deeply, fail safely, and form connections in their brains about language, logic, and problem-solving. Without that foundation, shortcuts with AI risk undermining the very skills AI is meant to reinforce.

Keep in mind that human brains evolved to thrive in social contexts. We crave connection and shared experiences. Neuroscience shows that social engagement activates reward pathways, strengthens memory consolidation, and increases motivation. Learning solely through technology risks losing these biological and psychological benefits. 

In short, AI’s promise lies in **supporting and extending** it by helping teachers mentor more effectively, giving students smart tools for reinforcement, and enabling professionals to learn continuously. 

## Policy and Practice: Guiding AI in Education
Educators and policymakers face a crucial responsibility to encourage healthy uses of AI while safeguarding against harmful ones. Key strategies include the following:

* **Clear guidelines for AI use in schools**: AI can be used for practice, feedback, and exploration, but assessments and graded work should remain human-supervised. The U.S. Department of Education’s July 2025 guidance emphasizes this distinction.

* **Investment in teacher training**: Educators must understand AI’s capabilities and limitations to leverage it effectively.

* **Ongoing research into AI’s impact**: Long-term studies on AI’s effects on child development, motivation, and learning outcomes are essential. The OECD’s 2025 report raises the importance of evidence-based policies in this domain.

* **Cross-sector collaboration**: Technologists, psychologists, and educators should co-design AI tools that complement classrooms. The EU AI Act’s classification of educational AI as “high-risk” sets a precedent for careful oversight.

* **Institutional initiatives**: Anthropic today launched a Higher Education Advisory Board and AI Fluency courses to help educators and students build practical, responsible AI skills. This initiative aims to guide the development of AI tools that enhance teaching and learning while preserving critical thinking and academic integrity.

Thoughtful policy and collaboration can make AI a tool that supports real learning, strengthens teacher impact, while also preserving the social and cognitive foundations that make education effective.

## The Future of Learning
I don’t believe AI will “revolutionize” the educational system. 

In fact, the best version of education may already exist: a teacher and students in a classroom, connecting directly, learning together, and wrestling with ideas in real time. 

Technology can enhance that experience by offering tools and supplemental reinforcement, but it should never distract from the core mission of helping students think deeply, struggle thoughtfully, and grow socially and cognitively.

AI’s role is to enrich. Done well, it can free teachers to mentor more effectively, give students new ways to explore and practice, and support lifelong learning beyond schooling.

At its core, AI’s promise in education is to support deliberate learning by helping students engage System 2 to build System 1 skills that last a lifetime, without ever losing sight of the irreplaceable power of the classroom.

The challenge ahead is not to choose between tradition and technology, but to integrate them while preserving the heart of education and expanding its possibilities.
