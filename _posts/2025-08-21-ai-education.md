# The Evolution of Education in the Age of AI

Imagine walking into a classroom where every student has a superintelligent assistant. This assistant can answer questions instantly, generate explanations, create personalized exercises, and offer feedback. At first, this seems amazing. After all, personalized learning for students may help all students learn equally well. 

But let’s pause for a moment. What would it mean for learning when the answers are always at your fingertips? What happens to curiosity, resilience, and human connection in such an environment?

Education has always been about more than just knowing the answers. At its heart, it prepares people to think deeply, make informed choices, and thrive in communities. That mission doesn’t vanish in the age of artificial intelligence. 

What changes are the tools we have at our disposal and the consequences if we misuse them.

## Learning, Not Just Information
Learning is effortful, sometimes frustrating, and occasionally humbling. Yet a simple truth remains: we learn best when we struggle a little.

Psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky distinguished between two modes of thought:
* System 1: the fast, intuitive part of our brain
* System 2: the slower, deliberate reasoning we engage when analyzing, practicing, and reflecting
Deep learning requires sustained engagement of System 2, allowing skills practiced deliberately to eventually become automatic in System 1. 

Cognitive load theory (and, frankly, most of our experiences in college) shows that we cannot passively absorb complex concepts. Instead we need repetition, reflection, and challenge to commit knowledge into long-term memory. It’s why schools emphasize daily practice, weekly repetition, and a bit of a challenge to drive growth. 

Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development makes the same point: growth happens when learners are stretched just beyond their comfort zones. When they are challenged, but not overwhelmed, ideally with guidance.

Consider a student learning algebra. They struggle through equations, make mistakes, and gradually build an intuitive model of how to approach different problems. This struggle and experimentation strengthens reasoning skills and lays the foundation for problem-solving across contexts. It’s why prestigious universities often say their students “learn how to learn”. The rigor itself is what shapes lasting cognitive habits.

If AI is used primarily as a shortcut, that struggle disappears. The student may see the answer but wouldn’t internalize the reasoning behind it. Knowledge remains superficial.

As we know, true learning isn’t simply knowing what is correct. It’s understanding why it’s correct and being able to apply and adapt that reasoning in unfamiliar situations.

Maybe AI can support this process, but only if it is treated as a guide, not a replacement.

## Lessons from History (and from the Classroom)
This is not the first time technology has been hailed as “revolutionary” for education.

Thomas Edison once predicted motion pictures would replace textbooks. Radio and television were promised to democratize knowledge. Decades later, MOOCs (massive open online courses) were said to make elite education universally accessible. Each of these innovations served as great tools for access to information, but none “revolutionized” the education system itself. 

As historian Larry Cuban observed in Oversold and Underused (2001), the impact of technology in classrooms has consistently fallen short of the hype. Why? 

Because education is inherently a social ecosystem, not just the delivery of content. 

Students become learners through relationships. It’s the encouragement of a teacher, the support or challenge of a peer, the example of a mentor in which growth takes root. Knowledge isn’t delivered, rather it’s cultivated in conversation, collaboration, and shared experience.

The COVID-19 pandemic underscored this reality. Remote learning kept schooling ongoing, but without in-person connection, many students fell behind. McKinsey estimated that U.S. students lost, on average, five months of progress in math and four in reading after extended closures. Screens delivered information, but without real peers and teachers in the room, students were less likely to participate, less likely to connect, and less engaged overall.

I’ve seen this dynamic firsthand. Since 2020, I’ve taught math both remotely and in person, and I have to say, I love teaching in person far more. I can more easily connect personally with the students, and they’re also more engaged because I can give each of them attention. Walking around the classroom while they work on a problem lets me spot when someone is stuck and offer a quick nudge. Putting them into small groups for math games or challenge problems gives them a chance to wrestle with ideas together, learn from one another, and build confidence.

At Carnegie Mellon, as a TA for 15-281 for five semesters, I saw the same thing with college students I taught. Engaged students challenged assumptions, tested their reasoning against ours, and grew stronger problem-solving skills as they muddled through assignments. Several of my students went on to become TAs themselves, continuing this cycle of guided struggle and learning that no tool could replicate.

Teaching and learning go hand in hand. A teacher surveys the room, guides, and nudges, and a dedicated student works, struggles, and grows. Those small, human interactions, the questions, the hints, the shared epiphanies, are the heart of real learning. They’re also the reason past technologies, no matter how impressive, have never fully delivered.
