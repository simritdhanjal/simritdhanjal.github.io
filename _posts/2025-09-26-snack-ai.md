# Turning Doomscrolling into Learning: The Vision Behind “Snack.ai”
Doomscrolling has become an epidemic. Social media used to be distracting enough, but ever since TikTok and other short form platforms took off, addictive bite-sized content has been overtaking our lives. 

There’s a reason we feel good while scrolling! These platforms are scientifically engineered to hook us, but hours of scrolling in bed often leave us feeling exhausted, guilty, and frustrated by all the time lost.

But what if that time wasn’t wasted?

I’m setting out to build an app that takes the addictive nature of doomscrolling, but instead of mindless content delivers value. Introducing Snack.ai: a platform designed to make passive learning as addictive and effortless as scrolling through your social feeds.

## Why Snack.ai?
Now now - I’m an AI engineer, but I’m also a teacher at heart. Growing up as the oldest sibling, oldest neighbor, teaching math, TAing in college, and just mentoring those younger than me has brought me so much joy.

I love seeing people learn, and given how dependent on technology everyone has become, I craved a way to make education addictive, passive, and accessible in small bursts, suited for modern attention spans (mainly to use for myself). 

Snack.ai is inspired by this vision: learning any topic, from U.S. history to quantum mechanics, through short videos that keep you engaged.

By leveraging generative AI (across multiple modes - text, image, audio), we can create a personalized, lifelong learning experience, and, more importantly, an app I would happily use daily instead of falling into the social media trap.

## The MVP Approach
I don’t want to build just another social media platform that distracts from the intention of learning. 

For the initial version, interaction will be nonexistent. The focus is on building a minimum viable product (MVP) that delivers high-value educational content efficiently.

Here’s the technical workflow I’ve been exploring:

### User Input & Topic Interpretation
* Users enter a topic of interest (ex. U.S. History).
* The system interprets the topic and augments it with relevant details or keywords.
* Users can optionally verify or edit the generated topic and set parameters like course length.

### Content Structuring
* Topics are broken into Units, which are then subdivided into subpoints.
* Each subpoint generates a detailed, educational script, ideally 60 - 90 seconds long.

### Asset Generation
* For each script, the system identifies entities and augments them with context.
* A generation prompt is created specifying style, tone, and format.
* Visual assets (images, characters, backgrounds) are generated and optionally cleaned (ex. background removal).

### Scene Creation
* Scripts are split into scenes, usually by sentence or conceptual break.
* A vertical (16:9) blank canvas is prepared for each scene.
* Entities are positioned and resized dynamically, ensuring clarity and non-overlap.

### Dynamic Animation & Audio
* Words in the script trigger entity animations (“appear” actions) at appropriate times.
* Audio narration is added along with subtitles.
* Scenes are stitched together to create a smooth, scrollable learning experience.

### User Interface
Courses have a home page, allowing users to scroll through one topic at a time or intermix several.

### Future Optimizations
* While the MVP focuses on passive, scrollable learning, future enhancements could include:
* A personalized “For You Page” based on topics other users have explored.
* Advanced animation options: moving, replacing, or resizing assets dynamically.
* Diverse visual styles, color schemes, pacing, and audio to maintain engagement.

Snack.ai represents a new way to reclaim the time we currently waste on social media by turning doomscrolling into a pathway for lifelong learning. The vision is simple: make education as addictive, seamless, and rewarding as your favorite social feed.
