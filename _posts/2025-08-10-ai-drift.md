# We’re focused on the wrong AI threat.

In just a few years, artificial intelligence has evolved from a niche research topic into one of the most disruptive forces reshaping the world. Major companies race to integrate AI. Entire industries are being redefined. Public conversations are increasingly dominated by questions about artificial general intelligence, alignment, and existential risk.

I’ve studied and worked in AI. I’ve seen firsthand how powerful (and promising) these systems can be. From accelerating drug discovery to improving transportation and farming, there’s no doubt AI can be a force for enormous good. Still, some of the most widely used AI tools raise concerns about how they shape how we learn, think, and connect. Others prompt real questions about safety, bias, and intent. And the more we treat this direction as inevitable, the harder it becomes to change course.

The real threat isn’t AI replacing us. It’s us misusing AI in ways that erode human capability, agency, and trust.

This is Model Behavior, a series where we go beyond the headlines to explore how AI is shaping our society, and how we can shape it in return.

## The AI Boom Is Real. But So Is the Drift
The rapid growth of AI is undeniable. It’s no longer a futuristic dream. It’s embedded in workflows, industries, and everyday tools.

Yet this fast expansion comes with a subtle problem: drift.

We build more AI systems but ask fewer tough questions about their purpose and impact. AI is sold as a productivity booster but often replaces effort. Marketed as a tutor, it sometimes does the thinking for us. Promoted as connection, it can simulate it just enough to mask what’s missing. This is the drift.

Take Cluely, an AI assistant that monitors screens and audio in real time. Their CMO suggested “eliminating the need to think,” and the company has embraced “cheating on everything.” Or Character.AI, a chatbot app that has raised concerns over emotional overreliance, including a tragic case of a teen forming a deep attachment to an AI companion. Cognitive shortcuts become normal. Emotional dependence becomes invisible. Real learning and thinking are pushed aside.

Here’s what worries me:
* AI becoming a crutch for learning rather than a scaffold for understanding.
* Weakening genuine human connection by replacing it with simulation.
* Dampening brain activity, especially combined with dopamine-driven platforms.

These effects are piling up. An MIT study found that students using AI assistants during learning showed reduced brain activity in regions linked to reasoning. The work got done, but the minds were quieter. 

Layer that with social media’s short-form content, infinite scroll, and algorithmic feedback loops, and you have a recipe for softened minds. It’s not just using AI. We are being shaped by it.

If this becomes normal, will future generations learn to embrace complexity and think critically? We can only hope. When we optimize for engagement without cognition, simulate connection without care, and offload learning without reinforcement, we don’t just lose depth. We lose agency.

The longer this continues, the harder it will be to change course. Without deliberate direction and clear values, we risk heading somewhere unintended.

## AI Is Also Doing Amazing Things
That said, it’s important to keep perspective. This is not an anti-AI argument.

AI itself isn’t drifting off course. When applied with intention, it holds incredible promise. Recent breakthroughs are proof.

Consider AlphaFold from DeepMind, which solved protein folding, a biology challenge that took years in the lab, now solved in minutes. This accelerates drug discovery, vaccine development, and disease understanding.

In precision agriculture, AI helps farmers monitor soil, predict yields, and optimize irrigation, resulting in more food, less waste, and a smaller environmental footprint. Autonomous vehicles from Waymo to Tesla offer the potential to reduce traffic deaths and transform cities.

These are breakthroughs, not threats. The issue is how and why we use AI.

## Are We Aiming AI at the Right Problems?
So what are we building AI for?

Much development today targets efficiency, engagement, and automation, which is sometimes at the expense of meaningful impact. Tools mimic writers, replace tutors, and auto-generate code. There’s efficiency in that. But is efficiency the goal? The bigger question is whether AI expands human potential or simply replaces tasks.

Imagine AI that supports deeper learning, helping students reason through difficult problems instead of just giving answers. AI that helps policymakers model legislation effects before decisions are made. Tools that bring expert medical advice to under-resourced clinics.

These ideas are already being built. But they exist alongside AI designed to prioritize speed, scale, and novelty over human flourishing. Often the incentive isn’t to deepen capability, but to capture attention and cut corners. For every AlphaFold, there’s an AI that automates effort, replaces learning with shortcuts, or simulates relationships instead of nurturing them.

This discussion isn’t about labeling AI good or bad. It’s about asking better questions:
* Where does AI add real value?
* Where does it generate noise?
* How do we guide AI to expand human potential rather than shrink it?

AI should help us think clearly, work efficiently, and solve important problems. It should be infrastructure for health, education, science, and policy. It should strengthen our ability to reason, connect, and create.

We have the technology. Now, do we have the intent? AI reflects not only what we build but what we choose to build. That choice remains ours, and it’s worth getting right.

## What’s the Real Threat?
The real threat isn’t rogue AI or sci-fi scenarios. It’s quieter and more subtle.

It’s building systems that slowly erode what matters most: curiosity, effort, truth, connection.

Not because AI is malicious. Because we aim it at shallow goals and call it progress. We prioritize ease over understanding, engagement over insight, automation over intention.

It’s not about losing control of AI. It’s about never defining what we truly want from it. Are we using AI to make people more capable, informed, creative, and connected? Or to make people passive, distracted, and dependent?

That’s not a technical problem. It’s a moral one.

Every system we create carries values, whether we acknowledge them or not. Without asking why we build, we reinforce the wrong incentives, scale the wrong outcomes, and call it innovation. That’s the true threat. Not AI’s power, but how we use it.

## Conclusion
If we get this right, AI won’t diminish what makes us human. It will help preserve it. The threat lies not in the technology, but in what we accept, prioritize, and fail to question.

So let’s focus on building systems that serve thoughtfully, responsibly, and well.

Let’s demand better model behavior.
