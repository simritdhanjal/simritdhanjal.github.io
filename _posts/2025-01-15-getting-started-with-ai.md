# Why I Love to Teach

For me, teaching is more than just explaining concepts — it’s about lighting a spark in someone’s mind.  
It’s the moment a complicated idea suddenly “clicks” for a student, when their eyes light up with understanding,  
that keeps me coming back.

I love taking something complex — like machine learning or AI development — and breaking it down into clear,  
simple steps. Not because the topics are easy, but because I believe everyone can learn them with the right  
guidance and encouragement.

Teaching is also learning. Every question challenges me to think deeper, to refine my explanations, and to  
see problems from fresh perspectives. I get to grow alongside the people I mentor.

Above all, teaching is about impact. Skills and knowledge are gifts that multiply — when you teach one person,  
you’re indirectly helping everyone they will influence in the future.

For me, that ripple effect is the most rewarding part of all.
