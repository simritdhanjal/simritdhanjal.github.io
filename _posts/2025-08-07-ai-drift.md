# The Real AI Threat Isn’t What You Think

We’re focused on the wrong AI threat.

In just a few years, artificial intelligence has evolved from a niche research topic into one of the most disruptive forces reshaping the world. Major companies race to integrate AI. Entire industries are being redefined. Public conversations are increasingly dominated by questions about artificial general intelligence, alignment, and existential risk.

I’ve studied and worked in AI. I’ve seen firsthand how powerful (and promising) these systems can be. From accelerating drug discovery to improving transportation and farming, there’s no doubt AI can be a force for enormous good. Still, some of the most widely used AI tools raise concerns about how they shape how we learn, think, and connect. Others prompt real questions about safety, bias, and intent. And the more we treat this direction as inevitable, the harder it becomes to change course.

The real threat isn’t AI replacing us. It’s us misusing AI in ways that erode human capability, agency, and trust.

This is Model Behavior, a series where we go beyond the headlines to explore how AI is shaping our society, and how we can shape it in return.
