# The Real AI Threat Isn’t What You Think

We’re focused on the wrong AI threat.

In just a few years, artificial intelligence has evolved from a niche research topic into one of the most disruptive forces reshaping the world. Major companies race to integrate AI. Entire industries are being redefined. Public conversations are increasingly dominated by questions about artificial general intelligence, alignment, and existential risk.

I’ve studied and worked in AI. I’ve seen firsthand how powerful (and promising) these systems can be. From accelerating drug discovery to improving transportation and farming, there’s no doubt AI can be a force for enormous good. Still, some of the most widely used AI tools raise concerns about how they shape how we learn, think, and connect. Others prompt real questions about safety, bias, and intent. And the more we treat this direction as inevitable, the harder it becomes to change course.

The real threat isn’t AI replacing us. It’s us misusing AI in ways that erode human capability, agency, and trust.

This is Model Behavior, a series where we go beyond the headlines to explore how AI is shaping our society, and how we can shape it in return.

## The AI Boom Is Real. But So Is the Drift
The scale and speed of progress over the past few years have been astonishing. AI is no longer a futuristic dream. It’s infrastructure, embedded in workflows, industries, and everyday tools.

But rapid growth has brought a subtler problem: drift.

We’re building more AI systems, but asking fewer hard questions about what they’re for. Less focus on purpose. Less on impact. Less on how they affect how we think, feel, and relate to one another. AI is sold as a productivity booster, but often replaces effort. Marketed as a tutor, but ends up doing the thinking for you. Framed as connection, but simulates it just well enough to mask what’s missing. That’s the drift.

Consider Cluely, an AI assistant that monitors your screen and audio in real time. Their CMO has publicly suggested the idea of "eliminating the need to think," and the company embraces "cheating on everything." Or Character.AI. It’s a chatbot app that’s raised concerns about emotional overreliance, including a tragic case where a teen reportedly formed a deep attachment to an AI companion. Cognitive shortcuts become normal. Emotional dependency becomes invisible. Real learning and real thinking get pushed aside.

This is what concerns me:
* AI becoming a crutch for learning rather than a scaffold for understanding.
* Weakening human connection by replacing genuine presence with simulation.
* Dampening brain activity, especially paired with dopamine-driven platforms.

And these effects are compounding. An MIT study found students using AI assistants during learning tasks showed reduced brain activity in regions tied to reasoning. The work got done. But the minds were quieter. Now layer that on top of social media: short-form content, infinite scroll, algorithmic feedback loops. The result? Brains aren’t being challenged, they’re being softened. It’s not just that we’re using AI. We’re being shaped by it.

If this becomes the norm, will the next generation learn to sit with complexity and reason critically? We can only hope so. Because when we optimize for engagement without cognition, simulate connection without care, and offload learning without reinforcement, we don’t just lose depth. We lose agency.

The longer we keep building this way, the harder it becomes to course-correct. And unless we start steering, deliberately and with clear values, we may end up somewhere we never intended to go.

## AI Is Also Doing Amazing Things
That said, it’s important to keep perspective. Let’s not get it twisted. This isn’t an anti-AI argument.

AI isn’t inherently drifting off course. It holds incredible promise when applied with intention and care. In fact, some of the most exciting breakthroughs of recent years have come directly from advances in AI.

Take AlphaFold, DeepMind’s model that cracked one of biology’s hardest problems: predicting how proteins fold. What used to take scientists years of lab work, AI can now solve in minutes. That’s not just academic. It's accelerating drug discovery, vaccine development, and our understanding of diseases.

Or look at precision agriculture, where AI helps farmers monitor soil conditions, predict yields, and optimize irrigation. More food, less waste, lower environmental impact. Even autonomous vehicles, from Waymo to Tesla robotaxis, offer the potential to reduce traffic deaths, reshape transportation, and make cities more livable.

These are not threats. These are breakthroughs. So the issue isn’t AI itself, it’s how we’re using it and why.

## Are We Aiming AI at the Right Problems?

This brings us to a critical question: what are we actually building AI for?

Much of today’s development targets efficiency, engagement, and automation, often at the cost of meaningful impact. We’re seeing tools that mimic writers, replace tutors, and auto-generate code. And yes, there’s efficiency in that. But is efficiency really the endgame? The deeper question is whether AI is expanding human potential or simply replacing existing tasks. There’s a difference.

Imagine AI that scaffolds deeper learning in schools, helping students reason through hard problems instead of just spitting out answers. Or AI that helps policymakers simulate the impact of legislation before it’s enacted. Or tools that bring top-tier medical expertise into under-resourced clinics.

These applications are not only feasible, some teams are already building them. But they coexist with a rising tide of AI that prioritizes speed, scale, and novelty over human flourishing. Too often, the incentive isn’t to deepen capability. It’s to capture attention and cut corners. Because for every story like AlphaFold, there are other tools that automate away effort, replace real learning with shortcuts, or simulate relationships instead of strengthening them.

So, the question remains: are we building AI to create a more capable, thoughtful, and connected society, or simply to shave seconds off our attention spans and simulate emotions we no longer take time to experience?

The goal of this series isn’t to paint AI as good or bad. It’s to ask better questions:
* Where does AI create real value?
* Where is it simply creating novelty or noise?
* How do we guide it toward applications that expand human potential instead of shrinking it?

That’s what this is really about. Not fear. Not hype. Direction.

AI should help us think more clearly, work more efficiently, and solve problems that actually matter. It should serve as infrastructure for better health, education, science, and policy. It should strengthen our ability to reason, connect, and build - not replace it.

We have the technology. The question is: do we have the intent? Because AI doesn’t just reflect what we can build. It reflects what we choose to aim it at. That choice is still ours, and it’s worth getting right.

## What’s the Real Threat?
Let’s bring this back. What’s the real threat when it comes to AI?

It’s not rogue superintelligence. It’s not ChatGPT gaining consciousness or robots rising up. Those are the headlines, but not the reality. 

The real threat is quieter. It’s that we keep building systems that slowly erode the very things we should be protecting: curiosity, effort, truth, connection.

Not because AI is malicious. But because we’re aiming it at shallow goals and calling that progress. We’re optimizing for ease over understanding, engagement over insight, automation over intention. It’s not that we’ve lost control of AI. It’s that we haven’t even defined what we’re steering it toward. Are we using this technology to make people more capable? More informed, more creative, more connected? Or are we using it to make people more passive, more distracted, more dependent? That’s not a technical question. That’s a moral one.

Because every system we design reflects a set of values, whether we admit it or not. If we don’t pause to ask why we’re building something, we’ll keep reinforcing the wrong incentives, scaling the wrong outcomes, and calling it innovation. And that’s the real threat. Not that AI becomes too powerful, but that we keep using it in ways that make ourselves weaker without even realizing it.

## Closing

If we get this right, AI won’t diminish what makes us human. It will help us preserve it. The real threat isn’t the technology itself. It’s what we accept, what we prioritize, and what we fail to question.

So let’s not just focus on building smarter systems. Let’s focus on building systems that serve us thoughtfully, responsibly, and well.

Let’s demand better model behavior.
