  <h1>Teaching Experience</h1>
  
  <p class="teaching-intro">
    I'm passionate about sharing knowledge and helping others learn. Here are some highlights from my teaching journey.
  </p>
  
  <div class="teaching-section">
    <h2>Computer Science Fundamentals</h2>
    <p>
      I've had the privilege of teaching introductory computer science courses, helping students discover the joy of programming and problem-solving. 
      My approach focuses on building strong foundations while making complex concepts accessible and engaging.

    <h2>AI and Machine Learning Workshops</h2>
    <p>
      Leading workshops on artificial intelligence and machine learning has been incredibly rewarding. 
      I love seeing the "aha moments" when students grasp how AI can solve real-world problems.

    <h2>Mentoring and Office Hours</h2>
    <p>
      Beyond formal teaching, I believe in the power of one-on-one mentoring. 
      Office hours are often my favorite part of teaching, where I can provide personalized guidance and support.

    <h2>My Teaching Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      I believe that everyone can learn to code and understand technology. My approach combines:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hands-on learning</strong> - Learning by doing, not just reading</li>
      <li><strong>Real-world applications</strong> - Connecting theory to practical problems</li>
      <li><strong>Growth mindset</strong> - Embracing challenges and learning from mistakes</li>
      <li><strong>Community building</strong> - Creating supportive learning environments</li>
    </ul>
