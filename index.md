    <h1>Hi, I'm Simrit</h1>
    
    <p class="intro">
      I’m a software engineer with a diverse background, from building AI for SpaceX’s Starship program to leading product development at early-stage startups.
    </p>

    <p>
      I create AI systems that address real-world challenges and help people work more effectively. Currently, I’m a founding engineer at <a href="https://www.silvertrain.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silvertrain AI</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Here’s a bit more about me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Artificial Intelligence from Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Computer Science.</li>
      <li>Since 2018, I’ve been teaching competitive math at <a href="https://www.randommath.com/simrit-dhanjal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Random Math Inc.</a>, where I was also among their very first students in 2014.</li>
      <li>When I’m not working, you’ll usually find me teaching, dancing, or hiking.</li>
    </ul>
